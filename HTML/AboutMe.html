							<h2>Hello my name is Morgane Kermer,</h2>
								<p>
									I am married and live in a flat in Vienna with my husband, my dog and my cat. 
									<br><br>
									I have been working since the age of 17 and already have tried many different jobs, only to come back to my childhood fascination: coding. 
									<br><br>
									I first learned it in school and during the covid-19 pandemic I took a close look at it again and learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript with the help of an app.

								I am an only child and lived with my parents until I was 17 years old.
								<br> 
								My mother is an english teacher and my father works in the IT section, so I discovered my love for computers pretty early. 
								<br>
								One day my father gave my an awesome gaming PC with black metal and blue lights and I was desperate to play on it, but he wouldn't plug it in. 
								<br>Instead he told me to 'figure it out'. 
								It took me a while to do so, but that was my first lesson on how computers work. 
								<br><br>	
								Around the age of 15, we had a compulsory subject about the basics of coding and text processing at school and I liked it so much, I took it as my optional subject the following year.
								<br><br>
								I moved to 'Frauenkirchen' at the age of 17, after having lived in Vienna for my whole life up until that point and started my first job as an insurance agent and lets just say, it didn't go well.

							<p>
								Also I was very lonely as I didn't know anybody and all my friends were in my hometown, so I got myself a cat. 
								I first named him Dry Bones (yes, like the character from super mario) but quickly changed it to 'Dwarf'. 
								After a year and a half I moved back to Vienna after a short Saturday-only job and being a help in the christmas rush, I began a school for dental assistents and worked 40 (or 50, or 60,...) hours a week. 
								I enjoyed it but I soon knew it was not my 'forever job'.

								My passion is latin- and standard dance. 
								I have been going to my dance school one to three times a week for 6 years now and met my husband in one of those classes. 
								We took a bachata class together in summer 2018, got together in november '18, moved in together in february '19 and married in october '19 (I know what you are thinking, but no. Neither of us had any religious ambitions &#128513;).

								We got a dog in august 2019, our little babygirl Liz.
								I go to a dog school twice a week and plan on doing dog agility with her, once she passed her 'BH-1 test'.

								After spending another year as a dental assistent, and another move into a bigger flat, I figured it's time for a new job and I finally wanted to do something that really fits me. 
								Something I really like doing. 
								After a bit of brainstorming I remembered how much I liked coding and during self-quarantine due to covid-19, I downloaded an app to learn the basics again. 
								I started to look for a school for frontend developing and found 'talentgarden' which I instantly liked, so here I am. 
								<br><br>
								In the present day!
