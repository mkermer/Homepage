<h2 id="datenschutz-en" class="adsimple-121375291">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We created this Privacy Policy (version 01.01.1970-121375291), to declare which information we collect, how we use data and which options the users of our website have, according to the guidelines of the <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp%3Btid= 121375291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these subjects sound rather technical due to their nature, but we have put much effort into describing the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="automatische-datenspeicherung-en" class="adsimple-121375291">Automatic Data Retention</h2>
<p>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically created and saved, just as it happens on this website.</p>
<p>Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our webserver (computer on which this website is saved/stored) automatically saves data such as</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121375291">
<li class="adsimple-121375291">the address (URL) of the accessed website</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">browser and browser version</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">the used operating system</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">date and time</li>
</ul>
<p>in files (webserver-logfiles).</p>
<p>Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get deleted automatically. We do not pass this information to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p>
<h2 id="cookies-en" class="adsimple-121375291">Cookies</h2>
<p>Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
For your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement, we will explain to you below what cookies are and why they are in use.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What exactly are cookies?</h3>
<p>Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
<p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses. http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>
<p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website, your browser submits these “user specific” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>
<p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party coookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.</p>
<p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">name:</strong> _ga<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121375291-9<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p>
<p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121375291">
<li class="adsimple-121375291">at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">at least 50 cookies per domain</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">at least 3000 cookies in total</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
<p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>
<p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Essential Cookies<br />
</strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Purposive Cookies<br />
</strong>These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Target-orientated Cookies<br />
</strong>These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Advertising Cookies<br />
</strong>These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>
<p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How can I delete cookies?</h3>
<p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore, you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p>
<p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p>

</p>
<p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search phrase “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How is my data protected?</h3>
<p>There is a “cookie policy” that has been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires the user’s consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.</p>

<p>If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority. For Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/?tid=121375291">https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tls-verschluesselung-https-en" class="adsimple-121375291">TLS encryption with https</h2>
<p>We use https to transfer information on the internet in a tap-proof manner (data protection through technology design <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN&tid=121375291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information. You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser’s top left corner, as well as by the use of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.</p>
<h2 id="google-maps-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121375291">Google Maps Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>On our website we use Google Maps of the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With the use of Google Maps, we can show you locations in a better way and can therefore adjust our service to your needs. Due to the utilisation of Google Maps, data gets transferred to Google and is saved on Google’s servers. In the following, we want to explain in detail what Google Maps is, why we use this Google service, what data is stored and how you can prevent this.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What is Google Maps?</h3>
<p>Google Maps is an internet maps service of the company Google Inc. With Google Maps you can search for exact locations of cities, sights, accommodations or businesses online via a PC, a tablet or an app. If businesses are represented on Google My Business, the respective location as well as other information about the company are shown there. In order to show route directions, a location’s map sections can be integrated in a website through a HTML-code. Google Maps depicts the earth’s surface as either a road map or as air and satellite images. Due to the street view and high-quality satellite images, it is possible for exact representations to be made.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">Why do we use Google Maps on our website?</h3>
<p>The efforts we make on this page have the goal of giving you a useful and meaningful experience on our website. Through the integration of Google Maps, we can offer you essential information on various locations. Therefore, you can spot our office address with one glance. Furthermore, the route directions always show you the best and fastest way to us. You can retrieve the route directions for traveling either by car, by public transport, on foot or by bike. The integration of Google Maps is a part of our customer service.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What data is stored by Google Maps?</h3>
<p>For Google Maps to offer its full services, the company must collect and store your data. This includes your entered search terms, your IP-address as well as your longitude and latitude coordinates. When you use the route-planner function, the entered start address is stored also. However, this data retention happens on Google Maps‘ websites. We can only inform you about it but cannot influence it in any way. Since we have included Google Maps on our website, Google will set at least one cookie (Name: NID) into your browser. This cookie saves data on your user behaviour. Google primarily uses this data to optimise ist own services and to provide you with individual, personalised advertisements.</p>
<p>The following cookies are set in your browser due to the integration of Google Maps:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Name:</strong> NID<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Value:</strong> 188=h26c1Ktha7fCQTx8rXgLyATyITJ121375291-5<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Purpose:</strong> Google uses NID in order to adjust advertisments to your Google searches. With the cookie’s help Google “remembers“ your most frequently entered search queries or your previous interaction with ads. That way you always receive customised adertisments. The cookie contains a unique ID, wich Google uses to collect your personal settings for advertising porposes.<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Expiration date:</strong> after 6 months</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Note:</strong> We cannot guarantee completeness of the information on saved data. This is, because especially concerning the use of cookies, changes can happen anytime. To identify the cookie NID, a test page was created, to which Google Maps was included.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How long and where is the data saved?</h3>
<p>There are Google servers in data centres across the entire planet. However, most servers are in America. For this reason, your data is widely stored in the USA. Here you can read in detail about where the Google servers are located: <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a>
</p>
<p>Google distributes data to various data carriers. This makes it possible to retrieve the data faster and to better protect it from possible attempted manipulations. Every server has emergency programs. Thus, should for example a problem with Google’s hardware occur or should a natural disaster impact the servers, any data will quite certainly stay protected.</p>
<p>Moreover, Google saves some data for a specified period. With some other data on the other hand, Google only offers the opportunity for deleting it manually. Furthermore, the company anonymises information (e.g. advertising data) in server logs, by deleting a part of the IP-address and cookie information after 9 to 18 months.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How can I delete my data, or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>Due to the automatic delete function for location and activity data, which was introduced in 2019, information that is used for determining your location and web or app activity is saved for either 3 or 18 months, depending on your preferred decision, and is deleted thereafter.<br />
Furthermore, it is possible to delete this data manually from your browser history via your Google account anytime. If you want to prevent the determination of your location altogether, you must pause the category “Web and app activity” in your Google account. Click on “Data and personalisation” and then choose the option “Activity controls”. Here you can switch the activities on or off.</p>
<p>Moreover, in your browser you can deactivate, delete or manage individual cookies. This function can differ a little, depending on what browser you are using. The following instructions will show you how to manage cookies in your browser:</p>

</p>
<p>If you generally do not want to permit any cookies, you can set up your browser in a way that ensures you get informed whenever a cookie is about to be placed. That way you can decide to either permit or refuse every single cookie.</p>
<p>Google is an active participant of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and safe transfer of personal data. You can find more information on this on <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI</a>.<br />

<h2 id="google-fonts-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121375291">Google Fonts Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>On our website we use Google Fonts, from the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).</p>
<p>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser. The data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely. We will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
<p>Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a list of over 800 fonts which href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?tid=121375291”>Google LLC provides its users for free.</p>
<p>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3>
<p>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times. Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">Which data is saved by Google?</h3>
<p>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data gets transferred to Google’s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for „Application Programming Interface“ and works as a software data intermediary.</p>
<p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google Fonts’ BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google’s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.</p>
<p>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser’s screen resolution and name to Google’s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.</p>
<p>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google’s aim is to fundamentally boost websites’ loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How can I delete my data or prevent it being stored?</h3>
<p>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google.

<h2 id="facebook-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121375291">Facebook Data Policy</h2>
<p>We use selected Facebook tools on our website. Facebook is a social media network of the company Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. With the aid of this tool we can provide the best possible offers to you and anyone interested in our products and services. In the following we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent to Facebook and how you can delete these data.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What are Facebook tools?</h3>
<p>Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called “Facebook Business Tools”. This is Facebook’s official name for the tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them “Facebook tools”. They include the following:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121375291">
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Facebook-Pixel</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">social plugins (e.g. the “Like” or “Share“ button)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Facebook Login</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Account Kit</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">APIs (application programming interface)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">SDKs (Softwart developmept kits)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Plattform-integrations</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Plugins</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Codes</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Specifications</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Documentations</li>
<li class="adsimple-121375291">Technologies and Services</li>
</ul>
<p>With these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities outside of Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</h3>
<p>We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable adverts to users, Facebook requires additional information on people’s needs and wishes. Therefore, information on the user behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook. Consequently, Facebook can collect better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products or services. Thanks to the tools it is possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website “event data” and uses them for analytics services. That way, Facebook can create “campaign reports” about our ad campaigns’ effectiveness on our behalf. Moreover, by analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products. Therefore, some of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins for instance, you can share our site’s contents directly on Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What data is saved by the Facebook tools?</h3>
<p>With the use of the Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.</p>
<p>Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member). However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called “Hashing” takes place. This means, that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of encrypting data.</p>
<p>Moreover, not only contact data, but also “event data“ is transferred. These data are the information we receive about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what products you buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as advertisers), unless the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, “event data“ can be linked to contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts. Finally, after the previously mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.</p>
<p>To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other data (that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies at <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies?tid=121375291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies</a>.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How long and where are the data saved?</h3>
<p>Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products. Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within 48 hours after they have been matched with their own user data.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.</p>
<p>The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your Facebook account works as follows:</p>
<p>1) Click on settings in the top right side in Facebook.</p>
<p>2) Then, click “Your Facebook information“ in the left column.</p>
<p>3) Now click on “Deactivation and deletion”.</p>
<p>4) Choose “Permanently delete account“ and then click on “Continue to account deletion“.</p>
<p>5) Enter your password, click on “continue“ and then on “Delete account“.</p>
<p>The retention of data Facebook receives via our site is done via cookies (e.g. with social plugins), among others. You can deactivate, clear or manage both all and individual cookies in your browser. How this can be done differs depending on the browser you use. The following instructions show, how to manage cookies in your browser:</p>

<h2 id="instagram-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121375291">Instagram Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We have integrated functions of Instagram to our website. Instagram is a social media platform of the company Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Since 2012, Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook Inc. and is a part of Facebook’s products. The inclusion of Instagram’s contents on our website is called embedding. With this, we can show you Instagram contents such as buttons, photos or videos directly on our website. If you open websites of our online presence, that have an integrated Instagram function, data gets transmitted to, as well as stored and processed by Instagram. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Therefore, your data will be processed across all Facebook firms.</p>
<p>In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight on why Instagram collects data, what data these are and how you can control data processing. As Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we have, on the one hand received this information from the Instagram guidelines, and on the other hand from Facebook’s Data Policy.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What is Instagram?</h3>
<p>Instagram is one of the most famous social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the benefits of a blog with the benefits of audio-visual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. To “Insta“ (how the platform is casually called by many users) you can upload photos and short videos, edit them with different filters and also share them to other social networks. Also, if you do not want to be active on Instagram yourself, you can just follow other interesting users.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">Why do we use Instagram on our website?</h3>
<p>Instagram is a social media platform whose success has skyrocketed within recent years. Naturally, we have also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, we attach great importance to diversified contents. With the embedded Instagram features we can enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting Instagram contents. Since Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook, the collected data can also serve us for customised advertising on Facebook. Hence, only persons who are genuinely interested in our products or services can see our ads.</p>
<p>Instagram also uses the collected data for tracking and analysis purposes. We receive summarised statistics and therefore more insight to your wishes and interests. It is important to mention that these reports do not identify you personally.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">What data is saved by Instagram?</h3>
<p>Whenever you land on one of our sites, which have Instagram functions (i.e. Instagram photos or plugins) integrated to them, your browser automatically connects with Instagram’s servers. Thereby, data is sent to, as well as saved and processed by Instagram. This always happens, whether you have an Instagram account or not. Moreover, it includes information on our website, your computer, your purchases, the advertisements you see and on how you use our offer. The date and time of your interaction is also stored. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram saves significantly more data on you.</p>
<p>Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume this is also the case for Instagram. Customer data are for example names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. These data are only transmitted to Instagram, if they have been “hashed” first. Thereby, a set of data is transformed into a string of characters, which encrypts any contact data. Moreover, the aforementioned “event data“ (data on your user behaviour) is transmitted as well. It is also possible, that contact data may get combined with event data. The collected data data is matched with any data Instagram already has on you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gathered data are transferred to Facebook via little text files (cookies) which usually get set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram function used, and whether you have an Instagram account yourself, the amount of data that gets stored varies.</p>
<p>We assume data processing on Instagram works the same way as on Facebook. Therefore, if you have an account on Instagram or have visited <a class="adsimple-121375291" href="http://www.instagram.com?tid=121375291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.instagram.com</a>, Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is the case, your browser uses the cookie to send information to Instagram, as soon as you come across an Instagram function. No later than 90 days (after matching) the data is deleted or anonymised. Even though we have studied Instagram’s data processing in-depth, we cannot tell for sure what exact data Instagram collects and retains.</p>
<p>In the following we will show you a list of the least cookies placed in your browser when click on an Instagram function (e.g. button or an Insta picture). In our test we assume you do not have an Instagram account, since if you would be logged in to your Instagram account, your browser would place significantly more cookies.<br />
The following cookies were used in our test:</p>

<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121375291">Note:</strong> We do not claim this list to be exhaustive. The cookies that are placed in each individual case, depend on the functions embedded as well as on your use of Instagram.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How long and where are these data stored?</h3>
<p>Instagram shares the information obtained within the Facebook businesses with external partners and persons you are globally connected with. Data processing is done according to Facebook’s internal data policy. Your data is distributed to Facebook’s servers across the world, partially for security reasons. Most of these servers are in the USA.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121375291">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data. Furthermore, you can manage your data in Instagram’s settings. If you want to delete your data on Instagram completely, you will have to delete your Instagram account permanently.</p>
<p>And this is how an Instagram account can be deleted:</p>
<p>First, open the Instagram app. Then, navigate to your profile page, select the three bars in the top right, choose “Settings” and then click “Help”. Now, you will be redirected to the company’s website, where you must click on “Managing Your Account” and then “Delete Your Account”.</p>
<p>When you delete your account completely, Instagram deletes posts such as your photos and status updates. Any information other people shared about you are not a part of your account and do therefore not get deleted.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Instagram primarily stores your data via cookies. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies in your browser. Depending on your browser, managing them varies a bit. We will show you the instructions of the most relevant browsers here.</p>
